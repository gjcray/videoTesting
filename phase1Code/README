This piece of software is for video codec auto testing. It can test the 
difference between two videos.

the major program running; one is host, where videos are playing. The video 
capture device is Epiphan VGA2USB. The driver for it should be installed 
beforehead on the client side.

In order to run the software, you need two computers. Connect these two 
computer using VGA2USB device.
In the server computer, go to the src folder, and modify socksrv.c to run your 
test video. Make the socksrv.c and run it in the terminal.
In the client computer, go to the src folder, and modify DEST_IP in sockclnt.c
